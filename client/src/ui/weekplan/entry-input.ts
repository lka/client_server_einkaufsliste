 * - './entry-input/entry-handler.js' for the main add meal handler
 * - './entry-input/input-creation.js' for input creation logic
 * - './entry-input/entry-save.js' for entry saving logic
 * - './entry-input/autocomplete-helpers.js' for autocomplete functionality
 * - './entry-input/date-utils.js' for date calculation utilities
 *
 * This file is kept for backward compatibility and re-exports all functionality.
